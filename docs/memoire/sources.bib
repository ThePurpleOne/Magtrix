	abstract = {An open-source tool that allows for a fast and precise analytical calculation of multi-layer planar coils self-inductance, without any geometry limitation is proposed here. The process of designing and simulating planar coils to achieve reliable results is commonly limited on accuracy and or geometry, or are too time-consuming and expensive, thus a tool to speed up this design process is desired. The model is based on Grover equations, valid for any geometry. The validation of the tool was performed through the comparison with experimental measurements, Finite Element Model (FEM) simulations, and the main analytical methods usually used in literature, with errors registered to be below 2.5\%, when compared to standard FEM simulations, and when compared to experimental measurements they are below 10\% in the case of the 1-layer coils, and below 5\% in the 2-layer coils (without taking into consideration the coil connectors). The proposed model offers a new approach to the calculation of the self-inductance of planar coils of several layers that combines precision, speed, independence of geometry, easy interaction, and no need for extra resources.},

Magnet is moved only in horizontal X-Y space. It can push small object, I have no way now how to pick and place object or I have no communication and feedback from robot. Feedback is possible with camera or hall sensors under board, also there is way to communicate with bot over NFC/RFID with coil under board... untested now you can move only one magnet, more magnets move paralel, but you can divide moving space to zones and use more robots etc. parking zones if you have more magneboots with different tools My latest design use 0.6mm board but this is very fat, bottom trackers are weak compared to top trackers I have plan make only tracking part from flex and controller as normal 1.6 mm board 5x5 mm moving magnets 4pcs x 2 mm magnet.},

	abstract = {FR-4 (or FR4) is a NEMA grade designation for glass-reinforced epoxy laminate material. FR-4 is a composite material composed of woven fiberglass cloth with an epoxy resin binder that is flame resistant (self-extinguishing).
"FR" stands for "flame retardant", and does not denote that the material complies  with the standard UL94V-0 unless testing is performed to UL 94, Vertical Flame testing in Section 8 at a compliant lab. The designation FR-4 was created by NEMA in 1968.
FR-4 glass epoxy is a popular and versatile high-pressure thermoset plastic laminate grade with good strength to weight ratios. With near zero water absorption, FR-4 is most commonly used as an electrical insulator possessing considerable mechanical strength. The material is known to retain its high mechanical values and electrical insulating qualities in both dry and humid conditions. These attributes, along with good fabrication characteristics, lend utility to this grade for a wide variety of electrical and mechanical applications.
Grade designations for glass epoxy laminates are: G-10, G-11, FR-4, FR-5 and FR-6. Of these, FR-4 is the grade most widely in use today. G-10, the predecessor to FR-4, lacks FR-4's self-extinguishing flammability characteristics. Hence, FR-4 has since replaced G-10 in most applications.
FR-4 epoxy resin systems typically employ bromine, a halogen, to facilitate flame-resistant properties in FR-4 glass epoxy laminates. Some applications where thermal destruction of the material is a desirable trait will still use G-10 non flame resistant.},
