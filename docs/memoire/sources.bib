	abstract = {Connectivity using interband frequencies in 4G and 5G radio access networks, for example, carrier aggregation or dual-connectivity, incurs high receiver complexity and power consumption, in particular, when implemented using multiple radio units. Employing concurrent, multiband, direct {RF} sampling in a single radio chain architecture reduces the {RF} component count, leading to lower receiver complexity and power consumption. For this architecture, as the composite signal from multiple concurrent bands is digitized by a common analogue-to-digital converter ({ADC}), the bit resolution critically affects system performance. In this paper, the effect of {ADC} resolution on the error vector magnitude ({EVM}) and Block Error Rate ({BLER}) performance of a concurrent, multiband, direct {RF} sampling receiver is investigated. Simulation and hardware measurement of a tri-band Long Term Evolution ({LTE}) system supporting three simultaneously active channels at 888 {MHz}, 1.92 {GHz} and 2.52 {GHz} is evaluated when reducing the {ADC} resolution from 8 to 3 bits. Interband interference measurements demonstrate that the multiband, direct {RF} sampling, wideband {LTE} receiver remains 3GPP compliant at 4-bit {ADC} resolution with the signalto-noise-ratio ({SNR}) desensitization over a single-band receiver limited to 9 {dB} in the 888 {MHz} band.},

	abstract = {To facilitate navigation and tracking, {UAVs} (unmanned aerial vehicles) or drones rely on the global positioning system ({GPS}). Still, unmanned aerial vehicles are resistless to {GPS} spoofing attacks, which involve manipulating {GPS} module receivers by transmitting altered signals. For example, an adversary using an adverse {GPS} simulator could broadcast counterfeit {GPS} signals, causing a {GPS}-reliant {UAV} to deviate from its intended flight path. This can result in loss of position accuracy and potentially cause a crash or unauthorized access to restricted areas. To mitigate this issue, several approaches have been advocated to detect {GPS} spoofing attacks. Motion Processing Units ({MPUs}) have emerged as a promising option, as they can provide precise measurements of the {UAVs} orientation and movement, enabling the mitigation and detection of spoofing attacks on {GPS} signals. In this study, a technique is introduced for identifying and counteracting {GPS} spoofing attacks in drones or unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}) using data from the {MPU}9250. The approach employs data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer along all three axes to detect instances of {GPS} spoofing and recover accurate {GPS} coordinates. Any noteworthy divergence in the gyroscope readings is considered as a possible {GPS} spoofing attack. To evaluate the efficacy of the propounded method, it is tested using real-world experiments, which demonstrate its capability to successfully detect falsified {GPS} signals.},

However, For the same signal as the {GPS} provides the receiver, signal generator is required to generate the {RF} signal that reflects the pseudorange that different are measured to the same signal as the {GPS}, not the {GPS} satellites. This paper provides an overview of a device which can generate an L1 {GPS} signal at the same time as the {GPS} signal, and compared with Live {GPS} signal performance verification for this. As a result, we can check that the navigation of the {GPS} signals generated in synchronization with the {GPS} signal can be maintained in the same manner as Live {GPS}, and the relative pseudorange error between channels are kept constant when generating signals of the long.},

A typical {GPS} receiver is readily expressible as a block diagram, making a graphical approach a natural choice for implementing {GPS} {SDRs}. This paper presents a real-time, graphical implementation of a {GPS} {SDR}, consisting of two modes: acquisition and tracking. The acquisition mode performs a twodimensional fast Fourier transform ({FFT})-based search over code offsets and Doppler frequencies. The carrier-aided code tracking mode consists of the following main building blocks: correlators, code and carrier phase detectors, code and carrier phase ﬁlters, a code generator, and a numerically-controlled oscillator. The presented {GPS} {SDR} provides an abstraction level that enables future research endeavors.},

	abstract = {A satellite navigation or satnav system is a system that uses satellites to provide autonomous geopositioning. A satellite navigation system with global coverage is termed global navigation satellite system ({GNSS}). As of 2023, four global systems are operational: the United States's Global Positioning System ({GPS}), Russia's Global Navigation Satellite System ({GLONASS}),  China's {BeiDou} Navigation Satellite System, and the European Space Agency's Galileo.Regional navigation satellite systems in use are Japan's Quasi-Zenith Satellite System ({QZSS}), a {GPS} satellite-based augmentation system to enhance the accuracy of {GPS}, with satellite navigation independent of {GPS} scheduled for 2023, and the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System ({IRNSS}) or {NavIC}, which is planned to be expanded to a global version in the long term.Satellite navigation allows satellite navigation devices to determine their location (longitude, latitude, and altitude/elevation) to high precision (within a few centimeters to meters) using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites. The system can be used for providing position, navigation or for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver (satellite tracking). The signals also allow the electronic receiver to calculate the current local time to a high precision, which allows time synchronisation. These uses are collectively known as Positioning, Navigation and Timing ({PNT}). Satnav systems operate independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the positioning information generated.
Global coverage for each system is generally achieved by a satellite constellation of 18–30 medium Earth orbit ({MEO}) satellites spread between several orbital planes. The actual systems vary, but all use orbital inclinations of {\textgreater}50° and orbital periods of roughly twelve hours (at an altitude of about 20,000 kilometres or 12,000 miles).},

We examined each set of four satellites separately. Advancements in computer softwares have made computations much more precise. We can use iterative methods to solve {GPS} problems. Iterative schemes for solving nonlinear equations have always been of great importance because of their applicability to real-world problems.

	abstract = {{GPS} signals are broadcast by Global Positioning System satellites to enable satellite navigation. Receivers on or near the Earth's surface can determine location, time, and velocity using this information. The {GPS} satellite constellation is operated by the 2nd Space Operations Squadron (2SOPS) of Space Delta 8, United States Space Force.
{GPS} signals include ranging signals, which are used to measure the distance to the satellite, and navigation messages. The navigation messages include ephemeris data which are used both in trilateration to calculate the position of each satellite in orbit and also to provide information about the time and status of the entire satellite constellation, called the almanac.
There are four {GPS} signal specifications designed for civilian use. In order of date of introduction, these are: L1 C/A, L2C, L5 and L1C. L1 C/A is also called the legacy signal and is broadcast by all currently operational satellites. L2C, L5 and L1C are modernized signals and are only broadcast by newer satellites (or not yet at all). Furthermore, as of January 2021, none of these three signals are yet considered to be fully operational for civilian use. In addition to the four aforementioned signals, there are restricted signals with published frequencies and chip rates, but the signals use encrypted coding, restricting use to authorized parties. Some limited use of restricted signals can still be made by civilians without decryption; this is called codeless and semi-codeless access, and this is officially supported.The interface to the User Segment ({GPS} receivers) is described in the Interface Control Documents ({ICD}). The format of civilian signals is described in the Interface Specification ({IS}) which is a subset of the {ICD}.},
