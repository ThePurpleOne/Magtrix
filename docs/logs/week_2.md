# Question 1 : Are halbach array really usefull in our case ?

# Question 2 : Compute the distance a magnet could be attracted at, using a certain coil.
- Need to compute the magnetic field (B) generated by a coil with a specific current at a specific spot.
- Get the magnet's moment (m) and the distance, looks like we can get it from datasheet or by calculating it. [https://www.e-magnetica.pl/doku.php/magnetic_dipole_moment](https://www.e-magnetica.pl/doku.php/magnetic_dipole_moment)
- Should be able to compute the force from the coil on the magnet
- Shear force is different from adhesion force [https://www.supermagnete.ch/fre/faq/Quelle-est-la-difference-entre-force-d-adherence-et-force-de-cisaillement-force-de-deplacement#ou-pourquoi-mon-aimant-au-mur-ne-supporte-pas-le-poids-maximal-](https://www.supermagnete.ch/fre/faq/Quelle-est-la-difference-entre-force-d-adherence-et-force-de-cisaillement-force-de-deplacement#ou-pourquoi-mon-aimant-au-mur-ne-supporte-pas-le-poids-maximal-)

# Question 3 : Influence of the coil's shape on the magnetic field
- More turn means more magnetic field but also more resistance thus less current for the same voltage.
- The shape of the coil seems to influence the magnetic field, look for sources ?
- The coil's shape also influences the direction of the magnetic field, could we use that to our advantage ?
